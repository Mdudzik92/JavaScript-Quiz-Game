<!-- Explanation of what the app is -->

This is a quiz app in which the user is prompted to answer five JavaScript-related questions. The user reads the instructions and clicks the button to start the game. A timer begins counting down from 90 seconds, deducting 15 seconds when the user gets an answer wrong. At the end they are given their score and can add their initials to be added to the high scores list on a separate page. The score data then persists in local storage.
