# homework04

In completing my homework assignment in which we are asked to build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions, I created a web page that says "Coding Quiz Challenge" as heading 1, and another heading with a Timer which begins at 60, showing the user they have 60 seconds to complete the quiz. They then are prompted with a button which says "Start the quiz!"

Upon clicking that button they are prompted with the first question and its possible answer choices. The timer begins counting down to 0 from 60. I was having trouble figuring out how to get the answers to state whether the user was "Correct!" or "Wrong!"

When the user clicks their answer choice, the next answer choice selection is shown with the new question, both replacing the former question/answer choices. 

When the user had answered 3 total multiple choice questions, they were done and I had attemped to include a screen after the questions "All Done!", "Final Score: " + their score, with an initials box where they are told "Enter initials" and then a Submit button, which takes them to a page that says their initials and their high score. I was unable to finish this in time to turn in the homework and was majorly stumped. I did utilize Google as much as possible but may just need to get better at narrowing down what it is I'm trying to find through Googling or something to achieve better results next time. 

I was however able to prompt the user with "All done!" when the timer ran out.
